# RustRecoilScript
Creates macros in the form of an XML file to import into Razer Synapse 3.
You can either go to my Repl.it and download it via the pre-existing files for the corresponding weapon OR you may run the script and create a "custom" macro which contains variables such as the amount of bullets that will be fired. If somebody knows coordinates which are more accurate and thus will control the recoil better you may contribute to this post.

# NOTE: This will not work with Razer Synapse 2, only 3.

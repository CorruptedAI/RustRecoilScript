# RustRecoilScript
Creates macros in the form of an XML file to import into Razer Synapse 3.
You can either go to my Repl.it, and download it via the pre-existing files (there is a macro for each corresponding weapon) OR you may run the script and create a "custom" macro which contains variables such as the amount of bullets that will be fired. In the case that you are unable to download the file, does after running the script, you may manually copy the file itself. There is also a smoothing function which generates mouse movements in-between the coordinates. The interval time between each time the bullet is fired does not change, but the path to each coordinate contains mouse-movements so the macro isn't as snappy/choppy. If somebody knows coordinates which are more accurate, thus resulting in better recoil control, you may contribute to this post.

Settings which the macro was created for:

Sensitivity(In-game): .5
DPI: 800
FOV: 90

# NOTE: This will not work with Razer Synapse 2, only 3.
